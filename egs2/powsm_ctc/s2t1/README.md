POWSM-CTC is a variant of [POWSM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24992),  the first phonetic foundation model that can perform four phone-related tasks.
Its multi-task encoder-CTC structure is based on [OWSM-CTC](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.549/), and trained on [IPAPack++](https://huggingface.co/anyspeech), the same dataset as POWSM.

POWSM-CTC is proposed together with our paper [PRiSM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14046), the first open-source benchmark for phone recognition systems.
Its decoding is much faster than encoder-decoder models, with similar or enhanced PR performance on unseen domain.


### Guidelines
1. Run stage 1-10 in `espnet/egs2/powsm/s2t1`
2. Train: stage 11
3. Eval: `espnet2.bin.s2t_inference_ctc` supports batched greedy decoding:

    ```
    from espnet2.bin.s2t_inference_ctc import Speech2TextGreedySearch

    s2t = Speech2TextGreedySearch.from_pretrained(
        "espnet/powsm-ctc",
        device="cuda",
        use_flash_attn=True,
        lang_sym='<unk>',
        task_sym='<pr>',
    )

    res = s2t.batch_decode(
        ["audio1.wav", "audio2.wav"], # a list of audios (path or 1-D array/tensor)
        batch_size=16,
        context_len_in_secs=4,
    )   # res is a list of str

    ```
    See [owsm_ctc_v3.1 recipe](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/tree/master/egs2/owsm_ctc_v3.1/s2t1) for more usage of `Speech2TextGreedySearch`.
